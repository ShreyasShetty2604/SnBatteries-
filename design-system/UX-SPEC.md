### Loading States
- Page transition: content fades in with `opacity: 0 → 1` over 300ms
- Cards: skeleton loader (animated shimmer) before images load
- Buttons: disabled + spinner icon during form submit

### Empty States
- Not applicable for this static/brochure site

### Error States
- Form fields: inline error message below field, red left border
- Map embed: graceful fallback — "View on Google Maps" link button

### Micro-copy
- CTA buttons: action-oriented ("Call Now", "Chat on WhatsApp", "Find Branch")
- WhatsApp pre-fill template: "Hi! I found you on your website. I need help with [service]."
- Form success: "Thanks! We'll reach out to you within a few hours."

### Scroll Animations (IntersectionObserver)
- Trigger threshold: 0.15 (15% visible)
- Effect: `translateY(24px) opacity:0` → `translateY(0) opacity:1`
- Duration: 400ms ease-out
- Stagger: 80ms between card children
- Never apply to elements already in viewport on load

### Accessibility
- All images: meaningful `alt` text
- Buttons: descriptive `aria-label` (especially icon-only buttons)
- Form: `<label>` for every input, `aria-describedby` for errors
- Focus ring: `outline: 3px solid var(--color-ring); outline-offset: 2px`
- Color: never sole indicator — always pair with icon or text
- Keyboard: Tab order matches visual order; Escape closes mobile drawer
